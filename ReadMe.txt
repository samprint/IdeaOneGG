Waht is the plan for this game

-I want one gear placed permanently in a position and it is the source of rotation, it is rotating all the time (Done)
-I want to be able to connect gears to it and and basically start rotating accordingly (Done, one gear)
-Every that connect to a rotating gear will rotate itself and will cause a gear connected to it to rotate
-I want to find a way to place gears in a way their teeth and position align perfectly
-How to create additional gear as clones of gear1
	-Problem when using thhe mouse all gears move together (Change code for moving the gear) (Solved Done)
	-How to avoid specifically the gear is colliding whith which gear but whith anygear instead thatt is rotating
