Waht is the plan for this game

-I want one gear placed permanently in a position and it is the source of rotation, it is ratating all the time
-I want to be able to connect gears to it and and basically start rotating accordingly
-Every that connect to a rotating gear will rotate itself and will cause a gear connected to it to rotate
-I want to find a way to place gears in a way their teeth and position align perfectly
