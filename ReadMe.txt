Waht is the plan for this game

-I want one gear placed permanently in a position and it is the source of rotation, it is rotating all the time (Done)
-I want to be able to connect gears to it and and basically start rotating accordingly (Done, one gear)
-Every that connect to a rotating gear will rotate itself and will cause a gear connected to it to rotate
-I want to find a way to place gears in a way their teeth and position align perfectly
-How to create additional gear as clones of gear1
	-Problem when using thhe mouse all gears move together (Change code for moving the gear) (Solved Done)
	-How to avoid specifically the gear is colliding whith which gear but whith anygear instead thatt is rotating  
-Make a condition if Pin already occupied don't accept another gear

Next steps:
-I want the gears not glitching everytime I move them
-I want a final gear goal to achieve the level
-Create a story arround the gear
-Try improve look and mechanics

-->Click an object to instanciate a gear
-->Drop a gear into another object to get rid of it

Did not succed in solving problem
